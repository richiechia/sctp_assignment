1. Business: Start-up doing a web application

In my start-up, it may be easier to use PaaS services, such as fly.io or supabase to do website front-end and back-end hosting. This will require less human resources to maintain load balancers, network etc.
The key focus will be on building the various web apps and deploying applications without managing the underlying infastructure as compared to PaaS.

As compared to a SaaS, i think there is a lack of flexibility there to be able to build my things on top of.
