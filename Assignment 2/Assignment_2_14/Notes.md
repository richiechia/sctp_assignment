Cost Optimisation is a technic that helps the company save money and more importantly ensuring efficient uses of paid resources. Or even spending additional money on additional heavyweights that may not substanially make a difference.
It could also limit the amount of expenditure and set a hard limit for the amount of money to be paid for a certain resource

## Explain how would you implement Cloud Architecture Design - Cost Optimization on your system.

First i would set up cost monitoring on my resources and tracking where most of the expenses are. Once i can aware of the expenditure, I think is to do a data analysis of the importance of the service that is using that amount of money and whether it is justified.

I can also limit the resources to only use till a maximum amount of money or set an alert to inform me of the big expense that may be upcoming for this particular one.

This needs to be an ongoing process to optimise cost and monitoring it
