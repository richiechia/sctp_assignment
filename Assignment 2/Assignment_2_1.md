Case:
Newly Launched eCommerce

Research

3 Methods that can be used are
Traditional Computing, Cloud computing and Hybrid Cloud Computing

Traditional computing relies heavily on physical hardware storage, where scaling involves higher hardware costs and requiring manpower to manage these servers. Not only that, it requires land space. High CAPEX

Cloud computing relies solely on remote data centers, and is accessible by 3rd party providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud. In this case, it is easy to scale, as it is up to the 3rd party providers and it only has OPEX.

Hybrid cloud is having the combination of both traditional computing and cloud computing. It is typically used more for security purposes where an organisation may want to self manage these servers. 

After understanding these 3 methods, if i was working in a newly launched ecommerce company, I will go for a complete cloud computing. 
As a company that is starting out, I may be unable to estimate the number of incoming customers and onboarding that I may have. With the usage of cloud, I may be able to auto scale my resources as required.
If things go south with my startup, I will be able to avoid the high cost from purchasing physical hardware.
Also because as a startup, I may not have enough resources to get people to manage a hardware of servers and finding land to host these things, may not make much sense.

Hence, I believe doing full on cloud computing as a start, makes more financial sense and managable in terms of workload and scaling up the application. I am able to fully focus on building features to enhance customer's experience.
