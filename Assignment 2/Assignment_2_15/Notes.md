## what is Cloud Architecture Design - Operational Excellence?
It is a framework and set of principles that aims at optimising performance, reliability, efficiency of cloud-based systems. There are afew principals which defines operational excellence.


## how would you implement Cloud Architecture Design - Operational Excellence on your system?

Perform Operations as Code

By utilising the same engineering coding concepts, we should define our entire workload / infrastructure through code, and update it by code. By doing so, we are able to limit human errors and enable a more consistent and expected response to events.

It provides a lot of benefits in doing so. 
Infrastructure as code (This enables repeatability, consistency and scalability)
Automation and orchestration (Provide same infrastructure in each environment and there are tools such as Terraform and AWS Cloud to help us do so)
Version controlling, enables the team to work on the same piece of infrastructure and building on top of it, auditting
Able to set the same monitoring and logging parameters in the code

Next is changing the code infastructure and code in small iterations, to reduce risk of major bugs in production.
