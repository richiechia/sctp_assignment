| Powershell                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Bash                                                     |

| PowerShell has a unique syntax that is designed to be more consistent and object-oriented. It uses cmdlets (pronounced "command-lets") that are structured like verb-noun pairs (e.g., Get-Process, New-Item). PowerShell's syntax emphasizes the manipulation of objects and supports the use of the .NET Framework. |
| Bash uses a simpler and more traditional scripting syntax based on commands and shell built-ins. It relies heavily on text-based output and input, using pipes (                                                                                                                                                      | ) and redirection to process and manipulate text streams |
