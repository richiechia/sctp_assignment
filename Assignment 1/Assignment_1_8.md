## Assignment 1.8

1. Give the advantages and disadvantages of magnetic storage devices

- Advantage

  - High capacity
  - Cost Effective
  - Durable
  - Longevity

- Disadvantage
  - Finite numbers of read write
  - Slower access time
  - Limit mobility

2. What is SSD? And why is it faster than HDD?
   Solid State Drive. It does not have moving parts compared to SSD

3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using optical media
   Advantages

- Longevity of data
- Portability
- Data security because it cannot be overwritten, it is read-only
- Archiving and backup

Disadvantage

- Slower data transfer than HDD and SSD, longer access time
- Damage and scratch will affect data reading
- Limited data compatibility

4. Discuss why hard drive spaces are lesser than advertised (Ex. 2TB is 1.81TB in Windows)

   AWS, Azure, iCloud, Google Cloud.

Pros

- Accessible anywhere with internet
- It can scale
- It backs up data, data redundancy
- Storage efficiency, only use the ones that you need
