# Assignment 3.11

Continous Integration allows me to maintain a single source repository, automate the build, do self-testing, speed to development very quickly, automate the deployment process

Advantages of CI

Being able to discover bugs early on during the SDLC cycle. Alignment and clarity on the current state of the work and code.

Tools such as Jenkins, Gitlab Actions, Circle CI are some tools used to automate these things. CI also allows for quality code checks and may streamline deployments


Some challenges of CI will include

-> Lack of automated testing. As writing tests are tedious and may contain alot, may not have so many in the beginning. Have to take time to build on this.

-> With many people making changes to the main branches and with many branches, may be hard to keep track of all these things.

-> There may be package vulnerability and security concerns when I am coding and merging code. Having CI will allow me to easily identify these vulnerabilities.
